Analysis:
After conducting a study on 249 mice diagnosed with SCC tumors and subjecting them to various drug regimens, the analysis suggests that Capomulin is the most frequently administered drug for treatment.

In summary, a correlation coefficient of 0.84 indicates a strong positive relationship between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume during the Capomulin regimen, suggesting that mouse weight may be an important factor to consider when studying the effects of this treatment on tumor growth.
