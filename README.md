# matplotlib_challange

## Overview
This challenge involves a comprehensive analysis of an animal study at Pymaceuticals, focusing on screening potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a prevalent skin cancer. The primary emphasis is on evaluating the effectiveness of Capomulin, a key drug for the management of the symptoms, in comparison to other treatments. The analysis includes data preparation, statistical summaries, and visualizations to provide a holistic view of the study results for the executive team.

##Purpose
The purpose is to offer insightful findings from the study data, to make informed decisions about Capomulin's efficacy and potential as an anti-cancer medication. The generated summary statistics, charts, and plots aim to succinctly communicate the comparative impact of Capomulin and other treatment regimens on tumor development. The ultimate goal is to provide a concise yet informative technical report for decision-making.

## Analysis:
After conducting a study on 249 mice diagnosed with SCC tumors and subjecting them to various drug regimens, the analysis suggests that Capomulin is the most frequently administered drug for treatment.In summary, a correlation coefficient of 0.84 indicates a strong positive relationship between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume during the Capomulin regimen, suggesting that mouse weight may be an important factor to consider when studying the effects of this treatment on tumor growth.
